Project Overview: SDG 16 - Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions
Goal:
The project aims to utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to improve the classification and summarization of reports related to peace, justice, and strong institutions. This will enhance the accessibility and usefulness of critical information for policymakers, researchers, and the public.

Objective:

Text Classification: Develop a model that can categorize reports or documents into relevant themes such as peace, justice, or institutional strength.
Text Summarization: Implement a summarization model to condense lengthy reports into concise summaries that highlight key information.
Project Structure:

Project Explanation

Goal: Leverage pre-trained NLP models to analyze and process documents related to SDG 16. This will help in categorizing reports into themes and summarizing them for better comprehension.
Outcome: Enhanced understanding of peace, justice, and institutional issues through improved document classification and summarization. This will support effective decision-making and engagement with SDG 16-related topics.
